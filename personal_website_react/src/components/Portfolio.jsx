            <h2>The Tiny Zoo</h2>

            <p>
              The Tiny Zoo project is about a request from a zoo to create a
              page that would help their new zoo keepers identify individual
              animals and their specific needs.
              <br />
              <br />
              In this project I created sections based on species with links to
              their specific needs. Within these sections I made a card for each
              individual that helps the keeper identify them.

            <h2>The "Goldblum" Problem</h2>

            <p>
              The Picasso (Goldblum for me) Problem provided our cohort with an
              image to recreate using only HTML and CSS to create shapes and
              format the picture.
              <br />
              <br />
              For my version of the solution I created the objects with HTML and
              CSS but also added images of the beloved actor Jeff Goldblum.

            <h2>Project Pantry</h2>
            <p>
              Project Pantry had an objective of sorting a grocery list into
              multiple categories using HTML and CSS.
              <br />
              <br />
              In this project I created the sections based on food type and used
              colors through CSS styling to assist in quickly identifying the
              needed items.
