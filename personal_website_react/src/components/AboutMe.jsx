          <h2>My Career So Far</h2>
          <p>
            After 15 years in retail management, most recently with{' '}
            <a href='https://www.zgallerie.com'>Z Gallerie</a>, I'm taking those
            skills in a new direction.
            <br /> <br />
            Learning with Fullstack Academy will provide me the tools to explore
            a new industry with an emphasis on customer service and design.

          <h2>My Story</h2>
          <p>
            I was born in Oklahoma to a military family. We travelled around for
            my early childhood before settling in Utah for most of my school
            years. I moved to Texas my senior year of highschool and have been
            here since. <br />
            <br />
            I live with my partner of 15 years with our two dogs, Yuki & Amy,
            and our cat Ripley. <br />
            <br />
            We are huge nerds and love all things Sci-Fi & Fantasy.
